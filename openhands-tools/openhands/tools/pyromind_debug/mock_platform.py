"""Stand-in for the real Pyromind debug/试跑 platform API.

The real integration submits the current ``workflow.py`` to an external,
asynchronous debug API together with a callback URL. Some time later
(observed to be ~30s-2min for this workload) the platform calls back to
``POST /api/pyromind/debug/callback`` with the run's outcome, and that
endpoint resolves the same :class:`DebugResultBroker` used here. Swapping
this mock for the real client only changes how ``submit`` is implemented;
the broker/callback contract does not change.

This mock deliberately goes over a real HTTP hop -- after the configured
delay, its background timer thread does an actual ``POST`` to
``{callback_base_url}/api/pyromind/debug/callback`` -- rather than touching
:class:`DebugResultBroker` in-process. That endpoint is what an external
platform would call in production, so exercising it for real here is what
gives us confidence the webhook wiring (route, request/response schema,
auth-exemption) actually works end to end, not just the broker in isolation.
